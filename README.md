# PersianPlatformPodcast

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.0.

## Overview
Our project aims to develop a podcast platform tailored for the Persian-speaking community, providing a centralized hub for discovering and listening to podcasts in Farsi. The platform offers a user-friendly interface where users can browse, search, and play podcast episodes from various sources, catering to diverse interests and preferences within the Persian community.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Business Objectives
- Provide a valuable resource for the Persian-speaking community to access and enjoy podcasts in their native language.
- Enhance accessibility to podcast content by offering a simple and intuitive platform that does not require user authentication or registration.
- Promote community engagement and collaboration by facilitating discussion and sharing of podcast recommendations within the Persian community.
- Ensure independence and reliability by developing a self-contained solution that minimizes reliance on external services.

## Key Features

## Technologies

## Limitations
